        There are some tags that are not in pairs and are referred
            to as empty tags (a.k.a. void)
        The opening tag indicates the start of your element
            and the closing tag indicates the end of your element
        The closing tag has the same name as the opening tag PULS
            a slash (/) preceeding the name

        The head area of your web page is NOT considered content
        The tags within the head are used by the browser to
            manage some display of the page, give additional documentation

    <h1>Basic HTML tags</h1>
    <h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
    <!--
        This is the coding block for your content in a paragraph
        The paragraph tag belongs to the "block" group of tags
        A "block" group tag places your content on a new line

        You can place all your paragraph text content on one physical
        line, howerver, that would require a lot of scrolling right & left
        You can have word wrap active in your editor and it will NOT affect
        how the browser displays your paragraph content. You can place
        your context on the separate lines yourself and it will NOt affect how 
        the browser displays your praragraph content.
    -->
    <p>The praragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line when
        your content is displayed by your browser. The browser does NOT display 
        your content in the physical style of how you have entered your code in
        html file
    </p>
    <p>This is a second paragrpah on the browser page. It will stat a new line.</p>
    <!--
        If you wish to use a component of a reserved tag (or the whole tag)
            you would be in toruble using the tag
        instead: you can use special character strings to represent components
            of the tag such as < (&lt;) and the > (&gt;) symbols
