    <h1>Basic HTML tags</h1>
    <h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
    <!--
        This is the coding block for your content in a paragraph
        The paragraph tag belongs to the "block" group of tags
        A "block" group tag places your content on a new line

        You can place all your paragraph text content on one physical
        line, howerver, that would require a lot of scrolling right & left
        You can have word wrap active in your editor and it will NOT affect
        how the browser displays your paragraph content. You can place
        your context on the separate lines yourself and it will NOt affect how 
        the browser displays your praragraph content.
    -->
    <p>The praragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line when
        your content is displayed by your browser. The browser does NOT display 
        your content in the physical style of how you have entered your code in
        html file
    </p>
    <p>This is a second paragrpah on the browser page. It will stat a new line.</p>
